License 
This dataset was collected by the City of Charlottesville and contains violations from 1999 to today and is continuously updated with new information.  It is published under the CC By 4.0 license, which allows for free sharing and adapting/modification of data, even commercially.  Appropriate credit must be given though, and any changes made must be made clear. 

Ethical Statements 
The data taken has been prepared to hide any identifying data: namely in making the license plates anonymized. As such, unless one knows the exact time and date of a ticket, it is difficult to track any ticket back to a person. The data should present no additional ethical considerations.
